# Practice Work

This repository contains mostly work that I have done as practice. 

The baby shower website is my main project from the Web Design Circuit that I took with General Assembly, which was a learning piece, 
but was used for the actual event. It is completely responsive. 

The Becca Codes website is my practice version of my portfolio at http://www.beccacodes.com. It is completely responsive, and I'm experimenting with adding in some JavaScript.

Thanks for checking out my work!

Cheers!
