			<h3>Client Goal</h3>
			<p>The client wanted to update his website, which was hosted on a drag and drop website. His goal was to appeal to a younger generation, and have his new website showcase his work and direct the user towards purchasing his albums, and clearly lay out his tour dates.</p>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>I designed and updated the website on the existing medium and hosting site, adding custom HTML elements. To modernize the site, I used large high-quality images and prominently incorporated the links to social media and his blog. I put links to his newest album on the front page, as well as created a store page with easy links to the most popular websites where young people buy their music.</p>
